        <h1>The Butterfly</h1>  
    <p> A butterfly is normally a day-flying insect belonging to the order of Lepidoptera and grouped in suborder Rhopalocera.
        These insects are closely related to moths,from which they grow.
        The discovery of moths dates back to 200 million years ago.
        Now, the life of a butterfly is closely related to flowering plants that their larvae feed on,and their adult feed and lay eggs.
        These butterflies have a long history of co-evolution with flowering plants; many of the details of plant anatomy are related to their pollination.
        The other notable features here are the extraordinary arrays of wings, patterns, and colours.Angiosperms developed in the lower Cretaceous but didnot become common until the upper Cretaceous.
        These insects were the final prime group to appear on the planet.<br>    
        They strengthened from moths in the earliest Cainozoic.And the earliest known butterfly fossil dates to the mid-Eocene epoch, within 40 to 50 millions of years before.There are so many types of butterflies, and the males and females of each kind do slightly vary from one another.Now, butterfly watching is a popular hobby for many, and some also keep collections of dead butterflies that they catch in their past.
        Similar to other insects with complete metamorphosis, a butterfly life goes through four distinct stages.It begins as an egg that hatches into a larva, which is otherwise called a caterpillar.Thereafter, the caterpillar turns into a chrysalis.Being is this stage, and it changes to be an adult butterfly.
        To complete the cycle, the adult mate and the female lays eggs.Like mentioned earlier, butterflies are beautiful flying insects with large scaly wings.Similar to other insects, they have six jointed legs, three body parts, a pair of antennae, exoskeleton, and compound eyes.The three body parts are the head, thorax, and abdomen.
